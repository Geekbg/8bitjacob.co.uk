The gh-pages behind my site

My name is Jacob and I am currently training in multiple programming languages and skills to further my knowledge and experience with the industry. This is acting as a sort of portfolio for any projects I end up working on.

I am starting with Web Development Languages (ie: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS...) and hoping to progress onto Game Development and Application languages (ie: C, C#, C++, Java, Lua...)

So welcome Web Traveller, and enjoy your stay(?)
