My name is Jacob and I am currently training in multiple programming languages and skills to further my knowlegde and experience with the industry, and in the future build a solid and successful career. This is acting as a sort of CV which will be frequently updated and expanded on throughout the upcoming future.

I am starting with Web Development Languages (ie: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SCSS...) and progressing onto Game Development and Application creation languages (ie: C, C#, C++, Java, Lua...)

So welcome Web Traveller, and enjoy your stay(?)
