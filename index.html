            <h2>About</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <p>My name is Jacob and I am student with experience in multiple programming languages, and in the future aim to expand on current knowledge in free time. I have been practising and doing online courses for sparsely for roughly six years and in that time have become proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Python, with more in the pipeline.</p>
                <p>I am currently studying Further Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, with the intention of embarking on a career in Biomedical or Software Engineering. I have worked (unprofessionally) with other Web Developers and organisations attended multiple hack days, to further branch experience and social skills.</p>

        		<a href="http://geekbg.github.io/BanditBash"><img src="images/Bash.jpg"></a>
                <p>A text-based fantasy adventure game inspired by the old choose-your-own adventure novels with directed paths and chapters, but re-created in HTML and JavaScript.<br><br> The project was a collaboration between Front-End Web Developer Max Glenister and myself, and spanned a months development time. Despite some residing flaws, the game operates successfully and I am overall proud of what was accomplished for what was one of my first full length programming ventures.</p><br>
